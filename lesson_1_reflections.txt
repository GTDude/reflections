How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

One can restart any version ie. a prior working one

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

One can decide when to commit keeping versions more distinct. A con is that manual commiting may cause changes to be lost

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git allows multiple files saves with 1 commit because many programming changes involve interconnected files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all the commits. git diff shows differences between any two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

can always go back and diff forward to see what broke or keep changes
